      "question": "How does the speed of a component correlate with its proximity to the CPU?",
      "answer": "Generally, components closer to the CPU, such as cache memory and RAM, operate at higher speeds due to faster interfaces and memory technologies, while components farther away, like storage devices and peripheral I/O devices, operate at slower speeds due to longer communication paths and slower technologies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which component in a computer is the fastest, and why?",
      "answer": "The fastest components are the CPU registers because they are located within the CPU and can be accessed immediately without any delay. They are followed by cache memory levels (L1, L2, L3), which are also very fast but slightly slower than registers."
